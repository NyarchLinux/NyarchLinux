Managing the package cache

check how many cached packages are available in my cache folder.
$ sudo ls /var/cache/pacman/pkg/ | wc -l


check the total disk space used by the cache folder.
$ du -sh /var/cache/pacman/pkg/


Automatically clean the package cache using pacman hooks.

To do so, create a file /etc/pacman.d/hooks/clean_package_cache.hook:

$ sudo mkdir /etc/pacman.d/hooks
$ sudo nano /etc/pacman.d/hooks/clean_package_cache.hook

Add the following lines:

[Trigger]
Operation = Upgrade
Operation = Install
Operation = Remove
Type = Package
Target = *
[Action]
Description = Cleaning pacman cache...
When = PostTransaction
Exec = /usr/bin/paccache -rk 1

Save and close the file.

From now on, the package cache will be cleaned automatically after every pacman transactions (like upgrade, install, remove). 
You don’t have to run paccache command manually every time.
