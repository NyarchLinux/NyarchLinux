Managing the package cache

check how many cached packages are available in my cache folder.
$ sudo ls /var/cache/pacman/pkg/ | wc -l


check the total disk space used by the cache folder.
$ du -sh /var/cache/pacman/pkg/


Automatically clean the package cache using pacman hooks.

To do so, create a file /etc/pacman.d/hooks/clean_package_cache.hook:

$ sudo mkdir /etc/pacman.d/hooks
$ sudo nano /etc/pacman.d/hooks/clean_package_cache.hook

Add the following lines:

[Trigger]
Operation = Upgrade
Operation = Install
Operation = Remove
Type = Package
Target = *
[Action]
Description = Cleaning pacman cache...
When = PostTransaction
Exec = /usr/bin/paccache -rk 1

Save and close the file.

From now on, the package cache will be cleaned automatically after every pacman transactions (like upgrade, install, remove). 
You donâ€™t have to run paccache command manually every time.
