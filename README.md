   <h3><b>Nyarch Linux</b> is a Linux distribution <b>made for weebs</b>, based on ArchLinux and EzArcher.</h3><br />

</div>

## Is it safe to use?
It is strongly suggested to <b>do not use this Linux distribution as daily drive</b>, since it is not made by a team of experts and there are way better distros out there. <br />
If you want a similar configuration to what our distro offers out of the box, you can use [Nyarcher](https://github.com/NyarchLinux/Nyarcher), a script to install Nyarch
customizations on top of any other Linux distro with Gnome pre installed. <br />
If you want to use it anyways, <b>Nyarch is not much more than a heavily bloated Arch Linux install script</b>, it relies on Arch Linux standard repositories, so for normal packages you will receive frequent updates that do not depend on us.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to the development of this distribution, please take a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/NyarchLinux/NyarchLinux/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Will you make other DEs spins?

### Why Gnome?
We opted for Gnome as first spin because of these reasons:
- Gnome has very well curated animations
- GTK applications and Gnome itself are very touch friendly and laptop friendly, these devices are often used to consume multimedia content, so anime, mangas, VNs, and LNs.
- Gnome is very elegant and modern, but very customizable at the same time, giving a good image of linux desktop.
- GTK applications look very coherent between them

However, there are also some cons:
- It is very different from what Windows has used users to, making it look complex for some (partially solved by Nyarch Customize)
- Gnome extensions often get broken after Gnome updates (it is a pretty big issue considering the rolling release nature of the distribution)
- Non GTK applications don't look coherent at all
### Will there be other DEs spins?
At the moment we have plans to create the following spins:
- Hyprland
- KDE Plasma

However in order to make them good, **we need contributions**. If you are interested in helping us, please take a look at [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/NyarchLinux/NyarchLinux/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
<br />
Please note that we want to make the different spins as coherent as possible, so applications have to follow their desktop philosophy if possible. <br />
For example, in the Gnome spin Komikku, a GTK application to read mangas, is preinstalled. In a KDE Plasma spin, if there is a similar application written using QT, it should be included.
